#  LEO – Learning Engine for Opportunities

## AI-Powered Academic Intelligence Platform

LEO (Learning Engine for Opportunities) is an AI-native academic ecosystem designed to support professors with adaptive teaching tools and guide students through personalized learning and real-world opportunity discovery.

It connects syllabus intelligence, skill graph modeling, and opportunity matching into one unified platform — ensuring no talent goes unguided.

---

##  Problem Statement

Modern academic systems are fragmented:

- Professors lack scalable personalization tools.
- Students lack structured guidance and opportunity visibility.
- Academic performance is rarely connected to real-world outcomes.

LEO bridges this gap using AI-driven intelligence.

---

##  Solution Overview

LEO builds a dynamic intelligence layer between professors and students.

### For Professors:
- AI-based syllabus parsing
- Auto-generated assignments & quizzes
- Knowledge gap analytics
- Class performance heatmaps

### For Students:
- Personalized skill graph
- Adaptive learning paths
- AI doubt resolution
- Internship, research & hackathon recommendations

LEO transforms learning from static delivery into guided, opportunity-driven growth.

## System Architecture

LEO follows a 4-layer architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**  
   - Web Dashboard  
   - Role-based UI (Professor / Student)

2. **Application Layer**  
   - REST APIs  
   - Assignment Engine  
   - Opportunity Matching Engine  
   - Analytics Services  

3. **AI Intelligence Layer**  
   - LLM Integration  
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
   - Skill Graph Modeling  
   - Recommendation Engine  

4. **Data & Infrastructure Layer**  
   - Relational Database  
   - Vector Database  
   - Cloud Storage  
   - Scalable Cloud Compute

##  Core Workflow

Professor Upload → AI Parses Syllabus → Concept Mapping  
Student Interaction → Performance Tracking → Skill Graph Update  
→ Opportunity Matching → Continuous Feedback Loop
